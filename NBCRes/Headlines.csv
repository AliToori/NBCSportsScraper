06/02/2021,"Ben Roethlisberger said RB Najee Harris is ""going to be something to see"" in 2021.","Roethlisberger said the first-round rookie out of Alabama is adjusting well to the NFL in what will likely be a workhorse season in Pittsburgh. ""He doesn't seem lost. It's not too big for him"" Roethlisberger said. ""His head's not spinning. ... The most exciting part is once he gets it and it clicks and he goes full speed."" Every indication is that the Steelers burned a first rounder on Harris to make him the featured back in their lackluster rushing attack which last season had the lowest yardage total in the NFL. Probably Harris won't have to be efficient to prove valuable for fantasy purposes. By August the rookie could be a consensus first round pick in 12-team leagues.",https://twitter.com/bepryor/status/1399759834581450754
